/**
 * Live assistant text — the part of a reply that has been streamed but not yet
 * written to the database.
 *
 * The server emits each piece of assistant text over SSE the moment it is
 * produced, but it buffers that text in memory and writes it as message rows
 * only at the end of the turn or on a 30-second periodic flush
 * (`adapters/web/persistence.ts`). The console renders from the database, so
 * treating an SSE event purely as "refetch now" asks for a row that does not
 * exist yet: the refetch returns the old list, no further event arrives, and
 * the reply stays invisible until something else triggers a read. That is why a
 * reply could only be revealed by reloading the page.
 *
 * The buffer is deliberately NOT fixed by persisting sooner. Buffered text is
 * provisional: `emitRetract` drops the last segment when the orchestrator's
 * reply turns out to be a workflow dispatch, and it can only do that while the
 * text is still in memory. Writing text early would leave retracted prose in
 * the history forever. So the lateness is load-bearing, and the right place to
 * fix the symptom is the view: show the streamed text immediately, and let the
 * database stay authoritative.
 *
 * These functions mirror the server's segmentation rules so the preview can be
 * matched against the rows that eventually land, without comparing content.
