<!-- AUTO-GENERATED — DO NOT EDIT. Regenerate with: bun run generate:capability-matrix -->

:::note
This page is **auto-generated** from each provider's `capabilities.ts` (the same
constants the workflow engine reads to enforce provider-specific behavior). Do not
edit it by hand — run `bun run generate:capability-matrix`.
A capability change fails `bun run validate` until this page is regenerated.
:::

Each column is a registered provider id (the value you set as `provider:` in a
workflow or `.archon/config.yaml`). A ✅ means Archon translates the corresponding
capability for that provider; a ❌ means the capability is unsupported. Unsupported
behavior is feature-specific: some optional fields are ignored with a warning, while
strict contracts fail closed. In particular, `context.resume` rejects an explicitly
unsupported provider at load time and an implicitly resolved one at runtime.

Reporting flags describe SDK fields that Archon translates into execution results.
Supported does not guarantee that every result reports a value or that usage includes
all nested agents. Unsupported fields remain absent; Archon does not estimate cost,
count events as turns, or substitute the requested model for an unreported model.
Cost reporting is independent of spend-limit support. Older providers may omit
reporting declarations; absence means unknown, not unsupported.

## Providers

- `claude` — Claude (Anthropic)
- `codex` — Codex (OpenAI)
- `opencode` — OpenCode (community) *(community provider)*
- `pi` — Pi (community) *(community provider)*
- `copilot` — Copilot (GitHub) *(community provider)*

## Capabilities

| Inline sub-agents (`agents:`) | ✅ | ❌ | ✅¹ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Tool restrictions (`allowed_tools`/`denied_tools`) | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Structured output (`output_format`) | **enforced** | **enforced** | **enforced** | best-effort | best-effort |
| Env injection (`env:`) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Spend limit (`maxBudgetUsd`) | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

| In-process native tools | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Mid-turn input (send a message into a running turn) | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Container exec (folder-project container backend) | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Strict-mode `required` coverage (every key in `properties` MUST appear in `required`) | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

## Caveats

- ¹ `opencode` — Inline sub-agents (`agents:`) — Config-file-based agent selection (named agents from `opencode.json`) with per-call model/tools overrides — not inline sub-agent definitions.

## Legend

- **✅ / ❌** — the capability is supported or unsupported for this provider.
- **Unknown** — the provider has not declared whether this reporting channel is supported.
- **✅¹ (superscript)** — supported, but with semantics that differ from the headline
  meaning of the axis — see [Caveats](#caveats).
- **Structured output** — `enforced` (the SDK/backend grammar-constrains decoding),
  `best-effort` (schema appended to the prompt, then validated + re-asked up to 3×),
  or ❌ (unsupported). See [AI Assistants → Structured output guarantees](/getting-started/ai-assistants/#structured-output-guarantees).
- **In-process native tools** — the provider can register Archon `NativeTool`s for a
  turn (gates auto-injection of Archon's `manage_run` tool into project-scoped chat).

For per-provider field-level notes (YAML syntax, caveats), see the
[AI Assistants guide](/getting-started/ai-assistants/).
